# CollimatR

## Overview
This app was created as a small pet project to assist astrophotographers with the alignment of a telescope's secondary mirror with the focuser using a phone and a collimation eyepiece.

_Disclaimer this idea was inspired from this ![post](https://forums.sharpcap.co.uk/viewtopic.php?t=5936) describing the approach in ![SharpCap](https://www.sharpcap.co.uk/). However, this requires the use of SharpCap compatible cameras AND having a CS lens to have the secondary mirror in focus which was not my case..._


## Requirements
- A telescope
- A collimation eyepiece
- A smartphone with a camera
- _(Optional but recommended)_ An eyepiece phone holder


## Workflow
1. Place the telescope tube horizontally (to avoid dropping something on your primary mirror).
2. Add a piece of paper inside the tube on the opposite side of the focuser to increase contrast. A second piece of paper can be used to block the view to the primary mirror simplifying the image.
3. Place the collimation eyepiece on the focuser and mount the phone to have the secondary mirror in focus in the focuser as shown below.

4. Take a picture and start the app (here).
5. Upload the picture and make scape, rotation, crop adjustments to your convenience
6. Adjust the red reticule to the edges of the focuser
7. Adjust the green reticle to the edges of the secondary mirror
8. From there you can evaluate whether the secondary is:
- Centered in the focuser
- Properly oriented toward the focuser (i.e. appears circular and not eliptical)
9. Iterate between steps 5 and 8 until the secondary mirror aligment with the focuser is satisfactory.
